"""
A node type that applies the swing equation and voltage dynmaics
to the frequency/angle dynamics.
In the following, we followed the implementation of the Extended Model/ third
order model including voltage dynamics according to K. Schmietendorf et. al.
"Self-Organized Synchronization and Voltage Stability in Networks of Synchronous
Machines", 2013.
The third order model is a special case of the fourth order model with Ed = 0
and Xd = Xd_dash.
Additionally to u, it has the internal dynamic variable ω representing the
frequencyof the rotator relative to the grid frequency Ω, i.e. the real
frequency ωr of the rotator is given as ωr=Ω+ω.
Keyword Arguments
H: inertia constant (given in [s]
P: active (real) power output, also called the mechanical torque applied to the shaft, given in [pu]
D: damping coefficient, (given in [s], see P. Sauer, eq. (5.156) where the damping torque is equal Dω)
Ω: rated frequency in [1/s] of the power grid, often 2π⋅50Hz
T_d_dash: time constant of d-axis, given in [s], see P. Sauer, chapter 3.7, p. 54 for a general explanation on time constants
X_d_dash: transient reactance of d-axis, given in [pu]
X_d: reactance of d-, given in [pu]
X_d: reactance of q-axis, given in [pu]
E_f: scaled field voltage, which, if set equal to 1.0 pu, gives 1.0 pu open-circuit terminal voltage. The physical device that provides the value of `E_f` is called the exciter (according to P. Sauer, p. 65)
