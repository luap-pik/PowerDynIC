"""
A method to find random pertubations in the case of systems with algebraic
constraints. There is then a set of valid initial conditions which lies on a so
called constrained manifold.
The system must still lie on this manifold after the random pertubation.
This could be applied to Basin Stability Methods in the case of complexer
Generator Methods which contain algebraic constraints.
